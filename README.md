# Keypad-Based-Password-Unlock-System
# Problem Statement:
This circuit consists of an ATmega32 microcontroller, a DC motor, keypad, liquid-crystal display, motor driver IC, LED’s. This is simple unlocking system which follows simple matching algorithm. The locking and unlocking system are made based on password, interfacing the keypad. This is more user friendly as it is digital security system.
 

# Abstract:
The digital security system is created by user interface. The user is given a password to enter, if the password turns right then the door is unlocked. Once the door is unlocked the user is given an option to lock the door again. If the password turns incorrect then the system will display saying “wrong password”.

# Introduction:
Password Based Door Lock System using ATmega32 is a simple project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system. Traditional lock systems using mechanical lock and key mechanism are being replaced by new advanced techniques of locking system. These techniques are an integration of mechanical and electronic devices and are highly intelligent. One of the prominent features of these innovative lock systems is their simplicity and high efficiency.
This automatic lock system consists of electronic control assembly, which controls the output load through a password. This output load is motor with electric load.
This system demonstrates a Password based Door Lock System using microcontroller, wherein once the correct code or password is entered, the door is opened, and the concerned person is allowed access to the secured area. 
Again, if another person arrives, it will ask to enter the password. If the password is wrong, then door would remain closed, denying access to the person.

# Software Requirements:
 Microchip Studio
 Proteus 8 Professional

# Hardware Requirements:
ATmega32
 Motor Driver
Keypad
Jumper wires
LCD
LED
DC motor

# Methodology:
Interface ATmega 32 microcontroller with keypad and lcd, dc motor, driver motor to build the model with password security system.
Keypad is given as input device for users.
The DC motor will run if the correct password is entered, indicating the unlocking of the door.
The same is displayed on the LCD saying
                    “CORRECT PASSWORD”
If the password is incorrect the LCD will display saying “WRONG PASSWORD”.
The user is given an option again to loch the system again.

# Conclusion:
Advantages of Password Based Door Lock System
1.This project provides security
2.Power consumption is less
3.Used commonly available components
4. Project is simple and easy

# Limitations of Password Based Door Lock System
1.It is a low range circuit, i.e., it is not possible to operate the circuit remotely.
2.If you forget the password, it is not possible to open the door.

# Results:
This security system can be used in simple lockers in homes and other required places. With more modifications and complexions these can even be used in banks and authoritative stuffs.
